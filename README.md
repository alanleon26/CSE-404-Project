# CSE-404-Project

## Overview

This Git repository serves as a comprehensive starter kit for facial recognition projects. Whether you are just starting with facial recognition or looking for pretrained models to enhance your existing projects, this repository has you covered.

## Contents

### 1. Beginning Code for Facial Recognition

This folder contains the foundational code to kickstart your facial recognition project.

initial_train+test_ideas.ipynb- unrefined pprevious facial recognition code. Need to work on refining.

### 2. Pretrained Facial Recognition Models

In this folder, you'll find pretrained facial recognition models ready for testing. These models are trained on the Well Known Faces dataset in various ways, providing a solid foundation for accurate and efficient facial recognition in your applications.

### 3. Validation Face Images

Contains images of the classes (people) within the Facial Recognition but these images are not within the dataset itself. These are outside validation images to test the model on different image styles/quality and test each models respective robustness.
