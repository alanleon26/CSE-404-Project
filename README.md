## Overview

This Git repository serves as a comprehensive starter kit for facial recognition projects. Whether you are just starting with facial recognition or looking for pretrained models to enhance your existing projects, this repository has you covered.

## Contents

### 1. Beginning Code for Facial Recognition

This folder contains the foundational code to kickstart your facial recognition project. It is very unrefined from an old group project, I will post a refined version soon

### 2. Pretrained Facial Recognition Models

In this folder, you'll find pretrained facial recognition models ready for use. These models are trained on the Well Known Faces datasets, providing a solid foundation for accurate and efficient facial recognition in your applications.
