# CSE-404-Project

## Overview

This Git repository serves as a comprehensive starter kit for facial recognition projects. Whether you are just starting with facial recognition or looking for pretrained models to enhance your existing projects, this repository has you covered.

## Contents

### 1. Beginning Code for Facial Recognition

This folder contains the foundational code to kickstart your facial recognition project. It is very unrefined from an old group project, I will post a refined version soon

### 2. Pretrained Facial Recognition Models

In this folder, you'll find pretrained facial recognition models ready for use. These models are trained on the Well Known Faces datasets, providing a solid foundation for accurate and efficient facial recognition in your applications.

### 3. Validation Face Images

Contains images of the classes (people) within the Facial Recognition but these images are not from the dataset. These are outside validation images to test the model on different image styles/quality.
